# Simple Chess Game
This is a very simple chess game developed for my research project **Reinforcement learning**.
This version will include minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning for the engine part.
Later version will be implemented using Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS).

# Usage
### Clone The Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sudiptarathi2020/Simple-Chess-Engine.git
```
### Install The Requirements
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
### And Just Run
```python
python3 ChessMain.py
```

# Disclaimer
Dont be fooled.I haven't implemented the full code yet.So nothing alpha beta or minimax is here.
Also no AI/RL is here yet.
